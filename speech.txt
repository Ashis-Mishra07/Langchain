Flight Pattern is a one-act contemporary ballet performed in 30 minutes.

[1] The music inspired the structure of the choreography, with a long and slow crescendo that transitions to a single voice. 

Crystal Pite, the choreographer of this piece, mimicked this structure in the creative process.

She focused first on the large scale of the crisis, then on a singular story. 

Pite felt that an emotional connection with a single story would be more impactful to the audience than many dancers on stage.

The piece begins with 36 dancers arranged in three equal rows, standing in profile to the audience and staring at a light while rocking in packed rows.

The dancers then move in canon, their spines extending and rotating to cause their heads to look back, then forward in a bow.
